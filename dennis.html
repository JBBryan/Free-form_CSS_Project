        <h2>Hello.</h2>
        <div>
          <p>My name is Dennis Field. I currently spend my day as a User Experience Designer for a successful San Francisco based start-up with over 50,000 businesses using their product daily. My free time is spent with family and helping prepare college students for what to expect as they get ready to start their careers. Like many, I also listen to Podcasts, have a Blog and spend time on Twitter. My passion is to help Clients, Students, Designers, Developers and Entrepreneurs reach their goals.</p>

        <h1>My experience...</h1>
        <div>
          <p>My professional career started in 2006 as an intern for an advertising agency in Columbus, Ohio. After graduating from the Columbus College of Art & Design in 2007, I was hired as a Graphic Designer for the award winning global retail design firm, FITCH. After my stent there, I co-founded a six figure web design studio called <a href="http://www.greenlinecreative.com/">Greenline Creative</a>, with my wife Julie. Since creating Greenline Creative, I've spoken at colleges, been hired as a User Experience Designer for a start-up in San Francisco, launched a global online songwriting community called <a href="http://www.frettie.com/">Frettie</a>, won "Logo of the Day" and have been recognized by Web Designer Magazine as "A rising star in Web Design".
          </p>
          <p>
            During my short career, I've been privileged to help brands such as <strong>Target, Walmart, Dick's Sporting Goods, NFL and Select Comfort</strong> reach their goals. For the last six years, I've taken what I've learned from working with those Brands and have shared it with hundreds of small to mid-sized businesses from all over the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            My goals today are pretty simple. I spend my time giving back by helping Students, Developers and other Entrepreneurs reach their goals by pointing them in the right direction from the start. If you have any questions, or need some advice on a project, don't hesitate to reach out. <a href="#">I'd love to chat with you.</a></p>
